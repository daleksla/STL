# STL: types
This section of the library does not contain any other types *per se*, rather it contains (short-hand) type aliases, traits, concepts (from c++20 onwards) & tags which are useful, such as in conditional compilation, for both built-in and library-specific data-types & structures.

Note: explicitly follow the accompanying documentation regarding which files to include, as MOST of the files in this sub-section are for internal use ONLY.

All code in this library is located in namespace `salih::types`.
