# STL
Salih's Template Library (STL) is a custom C++ Library inspired by STL (C++'s standard template library), Boost, Common Algorithms / Data structures &amp; Python abstraction

Note: this project serves as a hobby to explore into themes such as (dynamic) memory allocation & management, copy / move semantics, operator overloads, polymorphism etc.. It is not officially concerned with replacing any tried-and-tested features of C++ STL (though whether some features are better or not is up to personal discretion - I do have list slicing and some nicer string handling features, which people tend to always want to use so...). 

Regardless, my code a) is a lot more legible and I encourage you to read it and understand how it works b) basically runs exactly the same as the STL versions (with regards to memory, heap allocations and the like) - no downside to usage or experimentation!
